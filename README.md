The repository consists of HTML files and Python files

I am a little bit too lazy to organize everything, so feel free to look around and play around with the HTML files that were generated from the python files
HTML files created using Plotly, with data from bioinformatics pipelines using raw data from stomach adenocarcinoma PDXO
